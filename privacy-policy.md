# CommentMail for LinkedIn — Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026

## What data we collect

CommentMail extracts **email addresses and associated names** that LinkedIn users have **publicly posted** in comment sections on posts you view. The extension also reads **publicly visible comment text** to find these emails.

## How we use it

- All extraction is **user-initiated** (you click "Start Scan" on a specific post).
- All extracted data **stays on your device**. Nothing is transmitted to our servers or any third party.
- Data is used only to display results in the extension panel and to generate a CSV file that **you** download to your computer.

## Data we do NOT collect

- We do **not** collect your LinkedIn credentials.
- We do **not** collect your browsing history beyond the single post you are scanning.
- We do **not** sell, share, or transmit any extracted data.

## Storage

- Results are stored temporarily in your browser’s session storage so they persist while the extension is open. They are cleared when you close the browser or the extension context.
- If you use "Reset / New post," session data is cleared.
- We do not use any remote or cloud storage.

## Your responsibilities

You are responsible for using extracted data in compliance with:

- **Applicable privacy laws** (e.g. GDPR, CAN-SPAM).
- **LinkedIn’s Terms of Service** and Professional Community Policies.
- Do **not** use the extension for spam, harassment, or unsolicited commercial messages.

## Contact

For privacy-related questions, open an issue in the extension’s project repository or contact the developer through the Chrome Web Store listing.
